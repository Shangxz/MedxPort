How to install node and npm on local machine

1. download nodeJS from nodejs.org
2. verify you have node and npm command in command line, if not then i guess reinstall (happened to me twice)
3. navigate to BackEnd code folder in command line, type "npm install" and wait for it to finish
4. type "node server.js" and the server will be up and running.
